                This is an experiment based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuiryHHTrjU">this 3blue1brown video</a>.
                In the video, Grant Sanderson discusses an impractical system for mapping two-dimensional images into sounds
                using the Hilbert Curve.  Humans, of course, can't pick out these fine-grained frequencies well enough to
                put together any interesting images, but I was wondering what the mapping was like for notes in the musical
                scale.  Here you can mouse around the 2D and 1D spaces to see the mapping, and try out some chords to see
                what they would look like.
