Columnar vs. Relational Database Structures
Columnar Databases: Pros and Cons

- who am i - 15+ years programming BI software, wrote DivePort
- first poultry conference, no chicken jokes
- DI history, conversion from row-major MOLAP to column-major in-memory storage
- data cubes, pre-summarized tables
- didn't _just_ switch to column-major
- business intelligence doesn't necessarily mean relational
- relational doesn't necessarily mean row-major
- tables are usually two-dimensional, need to be saved to one-dimensional medium
- cache vs memory vs disk vs network...
- cost of memory very low
- row-major has advantages:
  - can add rows quickly 
  - efficient access to many columns on few rows
- column-major has advantages:
  - can add/remove columns quickly
  - efficient access to few columns on many rows
- MOLAP has advantages:
  - fast query time, especially on poor hardware
- in memory has advantages:
  - fast build time
  - fast access time
  - small footprint
  - scales better by sharing data
  - more flexibility of summarization
  - fewer performance cliffs
  - dive to the lowest level
  - fewer limitations (e.g. dimensions)
- but in memory has stricter requirements:
  - more, faster processors
  - more memory
